# Volcanic Bombs: Nature's Ballistic Missiles

During explosive eruptions in nature, volcanoes don't just emit ash and gas - they launch solid projectiles called volcanic bombs. These are molten lava fragments that cool and solidify during their airborne journey, forming distinctive aerodynamic shapes. From the spindle bombs of Italy's Stromboli to the massive blocks ejected by Japan's Mount Asama, these projectiles are one of volcanology's most spectacular and dangerous phenomena.

## Nature's Projectiles in Minecraft

Typhon faithfully recreates this volcanic spectacle using Minecraft's FallingBlock entities to simulate volcanic bombs:

- During eruptions, glowing fragments are ejected high above the volcano's vent with adequate blackbody coloring
- The bombs follow realistic parabolic trajectories, just as they would under Earth's gravity utilizing `FallingBlock` entities
- Each bomb can damage structures and create impact craters upon landing
- Like their natural counterparts, they can start fires and release residual lava

## Size Variation: From Lapilli to Blocks

Just as in nature, Typhon's volcanic bombs vary in size depending on eruption style:

- **Strombolian Eruptions**: Moderate-sized bombs (1-2 blocks), similar to Italy's Stromboli volcano
- **Vulcanian/Plinian Eruptions**: Massive bombs (3-5 blocks), comparable to historical Vesuvius eruptions

The size and frequency of bombs directly correlate with the volcano's explosion power, and eruption styles mimicking the relationship between eruption intensity and ejected material in real volcanoes.

## Impact Phenomena: The Dramatic Landing

When volcanic bombs hit the ground in nature, they create distinctive impact features:

### Crater Formation
Real volcanic bombs can create impact craters several times their size. In Typhon:
- Bombs create size-appropriate craters on impact
- Crater depth and width scale with bomb size and impact velocity
- The surrounding terrain is realistically deformed

### Cooling and Solidification
When real volcanic bombs land, they're often still partially molten inside. Typhon recreates this phenomenon:
- Upon impact, residual lava may ooze out from the bomb's interior
- This lava then cools into volcanic rock types according to the volcano's [lava composition](lava.md#silica-content)
- The resulting formations create realistic impact sites similar to those found at active volcanic areas

Experience the awe-inspiring spectacle of volcanic bombs in Typhon - but remember to keep a safe distance, just as you would from a real erupting volcano!
