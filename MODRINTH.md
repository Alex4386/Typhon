## What is Typhon?
Typhon is a Minecraft plugin that brings dynamic, destructive, and breathtaking volcanoes into your gameâ€”complete with lava fountains, volcanic gases, ash clouds, giant calderas, and much more.
Whether you love survival challenges, want wild new disasters for your server, or simply crave a world that feels alive and unpredictable, Typhon is here to shake things up!

## Features
* Spectacular Eruptions:
Volcanic eruptions come to life with thick ash plumes, glowing lava fountains, rock-shattering volcanic bombs, and flowing rivers of lava that truly threaten your world!
* A Living, Breathing Volcano:
Typhonâ€™s volcanoes mimic the real thingâ€”featuring not only eruptions but also fumaroles (steaming vents), geothermal activity, dangerous volcanic gases, and multi-vent systems.
* Stunning Visuals:
Using advanced Minecraft tools like BlockDisplay and FallingBlocks, Typhon brings you explosions, debris clouds, pillow lava underwater, and ashfall that darkens the sky.
* Inspired by Real Science:
Enjoy different eruption styles (Hawaiian, Surtseyan, etc.), realistic lava cooling, caldera collapses, and even new ores appearing in volcanic rock, just like real volcanic islands.
* The Challenge is Real:
This is not the just lava flow simulator, Typhon tries to implement all threats derived from Volcano, such as lava/pyroclastic flows igninting forests and flattening the slope, gases poison the unwary, and the landscape changes around you. Then, watch nature recover with new plants (primary succession) and rare ores.
