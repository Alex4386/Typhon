# Volcano: Nature's Fury in Minecraft
Typhon brings the awe-inspiring power and beauty of real-world volcanoes into your Minecraft world, faithfully recreating geological processes that shape our planet.

## Living Volcanoes
Unlike other volcanic plugins, Typhon's tries to mimick nature IRL volcanoes as much as possible. Implementing based on approximation of real-world volcanoes.

## Volcanic Features in Nature and Typhon

### Eruption Features
* **[Eruption Vents](vents.md)**: In nature, magma finds the path of least resistance to the surface
  - **[Fissure Eruptions](vents.md#vent-type)**: Linear cracks that emit lava in real volcanoes like Iceland's Laki fissure
  - **[Crater Eruptions](vents.md#vent-type)**: The classic circular vents found at the summit of most volcanoes
* **[Multiple Vent Systems](vents.md)**: Real volcanoes rarely have just one vent
  - **[Summit and Flank Vents](vents.md)**: Just as Mt. Etna has multiple eruption points, Typhon volcanoes can develop new vents
  - **[Parasitic Cones](vents.md)**: Small secondary cones that form on the flanks of the main volcano

### Eruption Styles
* **[Effusive Eruptions](eruption.md#eruption-style)**: Gentle lava flows with minimal explosivity
  - **[Pillow Lava](lava.md#pillow-lava)**: When lava meets water, it forms distinctive pillow-shaped structures
* **[Explosive Eruptions](eruption.md#eruption-style)**: Violent eruptions that eject material high into the air
  - **[Volcanic Bombs](bombs.md)**: Large chunks of lava that cool as they fly through the air
  - **[Pyroclastic Flows](ash.md#pyroclastic-flows)**: Deadly currents of hot gas and volcanic matter that race down slopes
  - **[Ash Plumes](ash.md#ash-plumes)**: Towering columns of ash that can reach the stratosphere

### Magma Characteristics
* **[Lava Composition](lava.md)**: Not all lava is created equal
  - **[Silica Content](lava.md#silica-content)**: Determines how runny or sticky the lava is
  - **[Gas Content](lava.md#gas-content)**: Higher gas content means more explosive eruptions
  - **[Ore Formations](lava.md#ore-formations)**: Volcanic processes concentrate valuable minerals

### Volcanic Environment
* **[Geothermal Activities](geothermal.md)**: The heat beneath your feet
  - **[Fumaroles](geothermal.md#fumaroles)**: Vents that release steam and volcanic gases
  - **[Volcanic Gas](geothermal.md#volcanic-gases)**: Dangerous emissions that affect plants, animals, and equipment
* **[Caldera Formation](caldera.md)**: When a volcano collapses into its empty magma chamber
* **[Lateral Blasts](lateral_blast.md)**: Sideways explosions like the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption
* **[Ecological Succession](succession.md)**: How life returns to volcanic landscapes
* **[Volcano Building](builder.md)**: The gradual construction of a volcanic mountain
