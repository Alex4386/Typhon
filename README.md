# Typhon Plugin
Typhon Plugin aims to implement real-life volcanoes and its behavior in the restriction of vanilla as much as possible.  

## Warning!
Currently This code is literal spaghetti.  
Will work on cleanup when I feel like to.

## System Requirements
* Spigot (or compatibles) for MinecraftÂ® 1.18.2
* A Really beefy (multithreading capable) computer/server
* Bandwidth to cover up extreme usage of FallingBlock and Particles

### Notice
This plugin utilizes a lot of particles and FallingBlock.  
which could impact your Network bandwidth usage.  
If you are going to use this in public server, **Please closely monitor your bandwidth usage.**

<!--

## TODO
* Automatic vent openings
* Caldera formation
  - Due to mass block updates, This causes bukkit to crash due to watchdog.
    Should come up with mitigations to implement this.
