# Typhon Plugin
Typhon Plugin aims to implement real-life volcanoes and its behavior in the restriction of vanilla as much as possible.  
See plugin in action: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDnQDAdq1Ok)  
Try plugin in action (Minecraft 1.20.4): typhon-demo.alex4386.me

## Warning!
Currently This code is literal spaghetti.  
Will work on cleanup when I feel like to.

## System Requirements
* Spigot (or compatibles) for MinecraftÂ® 1.20.  
  (Paper Recommended)
* A Really beefy (multithreading capable) computer/server
* Bandwidth to cover up extreme usage of FallingBlock and Particles

### Notice
This plugin utilizes a lot of particles and FallingBlock.  
which could impact your Network bandwidth usage.  
If you are going to use this in public server, **Please closely monitor your bandwidth usage.**
