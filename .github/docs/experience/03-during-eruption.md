# During Eruption: The Full Fury

When a volcano erupts, you'll experience the combined force of all volcanic hazards. This guide explains each threat you'll face and how to survive (or safely observe from a distance).

![Active eruption](placeholder-active-eruption.png)

## Starting an Eruption

```
/volcano <volcano_name> mainvent start
```

The volcano will begin erupting based on its configured style (Hawaiian, Strombolian, or Vulcanian).

## The Five Major Threats

### 1. Lava Flows 🌊🔥

Molten rock flowing from the vent.

![Lava flows](placeholder-lava-flows.png)

**How they behave:**
- Flow downhill following terrain
- Speed depends on eruption style:
  - **Hawaiian**: Fast, fluid flows that travel far
  - **Strombolian**: Moderate flows
  - **Vulcanian**: Slow, thick flows that don't travel far
- Generate new lava source blocks as they flow
- Cool into volcanic rock when they stop

**Threats:**
- 🔥 **Instant death** if you touch flowing lava
- 🏠 **Structure destruction** - Burns wooden buildings
- 🌍 **Permanent terrain change** - Covers existing landscape
- 🌊 **Flood-like spread** - Can travel hundreds of blocks (Hawaiian style)

**What to do:**
- ❌ **Never try to outrun lava** - You will lose
- ✅ Build on high ground or pillars
- ✅ Use non-flammable materials (stone, obsidian)
- ✅ Create firebreaks around important structures

**Special: Pillow Lava**

When lava meets water, it forms pillow lava formations:

![Pillow lava](placeholder-pillow-lava.png)

- Creates magma block "pillows" underwater
- Branches in multiple directions
- Leaves trails of cooled volcanic rock
- Safe to observe once cooled

### 2. Volcanic Bombs 💣🔥

Large chunks of molten rock ejected into the air.

![Volcanic bombs](placeholder-bombs.png)

**How they behave:**
- Ejected high above the volcano
- Follow realistic parabolic trajectories
- Size varies by eruption style:
  - **Strombolian**: 1-2 block bombs
  - **Vulcanian**: 3-5 block bombs
- Glow with heat during flight
- Create impact craters on landing

**Threats:**
- 💥 **Impact damage** - Direct hit can kill you
- 🏠 **Structure destruction** - Can damage or destroy buildings
- 🕳️ **Crater formation** - Creates holes where they land
- 🔥 **Fires** - Ignite flammable materials
- 🌋 **Lava oozing** - Release residual lava on impact

**What to do:**
- 👀 **Watch the sky** - Bombs are visible during flight
- 🏃 **Move constantly** - Don't stand still during eruptions
- 🛡️ **Build bomb shelters** - Reinforced roofs protect you
- ⚠️ **Stay far from vent** - Bombing is most intense near crater

**Danger zones by style:**
- Hawaiian: Rare bombs, small size
- Strombolian: Regular bombs, moderate size, nighttime "fireworks"
- Vulcanian: Frequent massive bombs, widespread impact

### 3. Pyroclastic Flows 💨🔥☠️

**The deadliest volcanic hazard.**

Fast-moving avalanches of superheated gas, ash, and volcanic matter.

![Pyroclastic flows](placeholder-pyroclastic-flows.png)

**How they behave:**
- Race down volcano flanks at extreme speed
- Follow valleys and terrain depressions
- Cannot be outrun by players
- Appear as rolling clouds of debris

**Threats:**
- ☠️☠️☠️ **INSTANTLY LETHAL** - No survival if caught
- 🔥 **Extreme heat** - Burns everything in path
- 🏠 **Total destruction** - Nothing survives passage
- 🌳 **Carbonization** - Converts trees to coal blocks
- 🗿 **Ash deposition** - Leaves layers of tuff blocks

**What to do:**
- ❌ **DO NOT try to escape if flow starts** - Too fast
- ✅ **Build on high ground** - Flows follow valleys
- ✅ **Stay far from volcano** - Only appears in Vulcanian/Plinian eruptions
- 🚁 **Observe from above** - Flying is safest way to see them

**When they occur:**
- Hawaiian: Never
- Strombolian: Rare
- Vulcanian: Common
- Plinian (caldera/lateral blast): Extremely common and widespread

### 4. Ash Plumes ☁️🌋

Towering columns of pulverized rock and volcanic glass.

![Ash plumes](placeholder-ash-plumes.png)

**How they behave:**
- Rise dramatically above the volcano
- Expand outward at high altitude (mushroom cloud shape)
- Superheated interior
- Visible from great distances
- Can collapse to form pyroclastic flows

**Threats:**
- 🔥 **Thermal damage** - Being inside the column burns you
- 👁️ **Visibility obstruction** - Blocks view of surroundings
- 💨 **Ash fallout** - Fine particles descend slowly
- 🗿 **Ash deposition** - Creates layers of tuff on ground

**What to do:**
- ⚠️ **Avoid flying through plumes** - Thermal damage
- 👀 **Use for orientation** - Visible landmark for volcano location
- 📸 **Best viewing** - Spectacular from distance
- 🏠 **Clear ash buildup** - Remove tuff layers from structures

**Intensity by style:**
- Hawaiian: No ash plumes
- Strombolian: Small ash clouds
- Vulcanian: Large, towering plumes
- Plinian: Massive stratospheric columns

### 5. All Pre-Eruption Hazards (Still Active)

During eruption, you also face:
- 🔥 **Maximum heat zones** everywhere
- ☠️ **Intense volcanic gases** throughout area
- 💨 **Maximum fumarole activity**
- ⚡ **All geothermal threats at peak intensity**

## Eruption Styles: What to Expect

### Lava Dome Eruptions 🗻

Viscous lava oozes to form a dome that grows over time.

![Lava dome](placeholder-lava-dome.png)

**What happens:**
- Lava piles up at vent instead of flowing
- Dome slowly grows upward
- When dome reaches critical size → collapses
- Collapse triggers pyroclastic flows

**Danger:** Unpredictable collapse timing

## Survival Strategies

## Stopping an Eruption

When you've seen enough:

```
/volcano <volcano_name> mainvent stop
```

![Eruption stopping](placeholder-eruption-stop.png)

The volcano will gradually wind down:
1. Bombing stops
2. Lava flow generation ends
3. Existing lava continues to flow and cool
4. Ash plumes dissipate
5. Status returns to lower activity levels

## What's Next?

After the eruption ends, learn about:
