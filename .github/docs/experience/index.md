## What Are These Guides?

Unlike technical documentation that explains *how* to configure features, these guides explain *what you'll experience* when you create and interact with volcanoes. They're written for players who want to understand the threats, phenomena, and spectacle that Typhon brings to Minecraft.

**Time:** 20 minutes

**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

**Experience:**
- Witnessing explosive eruptions
- Observing pyroclastic flows from safety
- Seeing volcanic bombs impact
- Understanding the full destructive power

---

### 4. [After Eruption: Recovery and Rebirth](04-post-eruption.md)

**Learn:**
- What the landscape looks like after eruption
- Ore deposits in cooled lava
- Ecological succession (how life returns)
  - Weathering and erosion
  - Primary succession
  - Secondary succession
- Managing succession (enable/disable, manual tool)
- Building on volcanic terrain
- Long-term landscape changes
- Aftermath of catastrophic events (caldera, lateral blast)

## Recommended Learning Path

### Complete Beginner
```
1. Create Your First Volcano (Hawaiian style)
2. Watch pre-eruption phenomena (Dormant → Minor Activity)
3. Start your first eruption from safe distance
4. Explore aftermath when cooled
```

### Intermediate Explorer
```
1. Create Strombolian volcano
2. Experience full status progression
3. Observe eruption with volcanic bombs
4. Manage succession and recovery
```

### Advanced Thrill-Seeker
```
1. Create Vulcanian volcano
2. Experience all pre-eruption threats
3. Witness pyroclastic flows from safety
4. Try catastrophic events (lateral blast, caldera)
```

## Safety First! ⚠️

**Remember:**
- Volcanoes are DANGEROUS by design
- Some threats are INSTANTLY LETHAL
- Always observe from safe distance
- Set your respawn point far away
- Have fire resistance and healing items
- Build with non-flammable materials

**Safe distances:**
- Hawaiian: 50+ blocks from lava
- Strombolian: 100+ blocks from vent
- Vulcanian: 200+ blocks minimum
- Plinian: 500+ blocks minimum

## What Makes Typhon Different?

Typhon simulates **realistic volcanic behavior**, which means:
- ✅ Real threats that require real caution
- ✅ Dynamic systems that evolve over time
- ✅ Spectacular visual phenomena
- ✅ Educational and immersive experience
- ✅ Consequences for careless decisions

This isn't just decoration - these are working volcanoes with genuine hazards!
